/*
Create a simple task management system that will track tasks in different categories: "personal", "work", "urgent", "completed", and "archived". By default, each category starts with 0 tasks. 
The application should allow the user to:

1) Invoke a function that allows them to add a task to their chosen category by passing in the category name. This will increment the task count for that category by 1.
2) Invoke a function that logs each category and the number of tasks in it.
3) Challenge: Invoke a function that calculates the total number of tasks across all categories. Based on the number of tasks, log out a message:
- Less than 5 tasks: "light workload"
- Between 5 and 15 tasks: "moderate workload"
- Between 15 and 25 tasks: "heavy workload"
- More than 25 tasks: "overloaded"
